## engineering_simulations_pipeline_boundary_conditions

Task:
1. Analyse if the data in the output is real
2. Fill the documentation from this step: "5. Run Boundary Conditions Processing

Execute GitHub Actions in the engineering_simulations_pipeline_boundary_conditions_sred repository:

https://github.com/Dmitrii-Zavalin-Deployments/engineering_simulations_pipeline_boundary_conditions_sred/actions
Repository link: engineering_simulations_pipeline_boundary_conditions_sred.

Validate output consistency before proceeding: Check the GitHub Actions run for any errors before continuing with the next step of the algorithm." doing Unit Tests
3. Link Unit Tests to step 5 in documentation
