# Brainstorming for Engineering Simulations Pipeline (SRED)

## **Objective**
The purpose of this repository is to centralize and automate the workflows for engineering simulations. This includes geometry preparation, meshing, solver execution, result post-processing, and overall pipeline optimization. By leveraging CI/CD tools, automated scripts, and reproducible configurations, this pipeline enables efficient, accurate, and scalable simulations.

## **Simulations Overview**
### **Types of Simulations**
1. **Fluid Dynamics Simulations**:
   - Focus: Simulating water and air flow interactions with engineering structures (e.g., turbines, pipes, or power station components).
   - Purpose: To optimize designs for efficiency, durability, and performance.
   - Tools Used:
     - **OpenFOAM**: For solvers such as `simpleFoam`, `icoFoam`, etc.
     - **ParaView**: For post-processing and visualization.

2. **Thermal Analysis**:
   - Focus: Investigating heat transfer in power station components.
   - Purpose: To ensure efficient cooling and thermal management.
   - Tools Used: Coupling OpenFOAM with thermal models.

3. **Structural Mechanics**:
   - Focus: Assessing stresses and strains under various loading conditions.
   - Purpose: To prevent material failure and optimize the geometry of structural components.
   - Tools Used: OpenFOAM plugins or external integration (e.g., with GMSH or Code_Aster).

4. **Multiphase Flow Simulations**:
   - Focus: Studying interactions between multiple fluids (e.g., air, water, oil).
   - Purpose: To analyze turbulence, cavitation, or other complex phenomena in turbines.
   - Tools Used: Multiphase flow solvers in OpenFOAM.

## **How Simulations Will Be Added**
### **1. Geometry Preparation**
- The engineering team will design and upload 3D models (e.g., cylinders, turbine blades) in **STL** or **STEP** format to the `geometry/` folder.
- Scripts for meshing automation (e.g., `snappyHexMeshDict`) will be added under the `meshing/` folder.

### **2. Meshing**
- Mesh configurations will be centralized in this repository to ensure standardization.
- Automation scripts will:
  - Generate high-quality meshes.
  - Validate mesh quality.
  - Archive processed mesh files for simulations.

### **3. Solver Integration**
- Solver case files (e.g., `system/`, `constant/`, `0/`) will be integrated.
- Each case will include:
  - Simulation-specific parameters (e.g., fluid properties, boundary conditions).
  - Workflow scripts for solver execution (e.g., `simpleFoam`).

### **4. Result Processing**
- Post-processing scripts will be added to generate animations, plots, and summary reports.
- Results will be uploaded to the **Results Repository** for centralized access.

### **5. CI/CD Integration**
- CI/CD workflows (e.g., via GitHub Actions) will automate:
  - Geometry and mesh validation.
  - Solver execution and basic result validation.
  - Logging and reporting.

## **Why These Simulations Are Included**
1. **Efficiency**:
   - Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., meshing, solver runs) reduces manual workload and accelerates project timelines.
2. **Accuracy**:
   - Ensuring consistency across all simulation components (geometry, mesh, solvers, etc.) minimizes errors and improves simulation reliability.
3. **Scalability**:
   - A well-defined pipeline supports scaling up from simple geometries (e.g., cylinders) to complex models (e.g., turbines).
4. **Reproducibility**:
   - Centralizing workflows and configurations ensures that simulations can be reproduced, even across different team members or projects.
5. **Compliance with SRED Goals**:
   - This repository aids in meeting Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SRED) program objectives, as it enhances R&D efficiency and innovation.
